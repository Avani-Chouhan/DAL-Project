# DAL Project
Designed an inverter-based oscillator and used the Dynamic Autonomous Loading (DAL) method to reduce startup time. Simulated the circuit in Cadence Virtuoso and analyzed improvements in oscillation behavior.
## Approach
We started by deriving the fundamental equations governing oscillator behavior.
MATLAB was used to plot these relationships and observe key trends and dependencies.
The overall problem was divided into smaller, manageable sub-blocks to enable modular analysis.
Each sub-block was examined and implemented in a sequential manner.
The full system was ultimately simulated using Cadence Virtuoso.
